A simple todo app based on the boilerplate from the [master branch](https://github.com/borealisgroup/react-boilerplate/tree/master). It should apply all the patterns and packages from [Borealis-js](https://github.com/borealisgroup/borealis-js).

## Experimentation

The example app is the perfect place for experimentation. Since it's small enough todo some quick refactoring. 

Whenever you are developing a new package or pattern, try to apply it here so that you can get a real sense of the impact. Later you can proof through a pull request that your package or pattern is a good idea. If this example doesn't have the feature that you like to optimize like fetching data from a server, feel free to implement it.
